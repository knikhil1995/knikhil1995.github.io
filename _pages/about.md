In my Ph.D. work, under the supervision of [Prof. Phani Motamarri](https://sites.google.com/view/matrix-lab/bio-of-the-pi), I am attempting to develop novel computational methods and efficient, scalable implementation procedures for extensions of Density Functional Theory (Eg. Spin-Orbit coupling, GW methods, RPA correlation etc.) within the real-space framework of finite element discretization. These methodologies will enable us to take advantage of present-day extreme-scale computing architectures, allowing us to explore new frontiers in materials sciences, which has not been possible thus far. Additionally, my PhD research will leverage these capabilities to conduct systematically convergent large-scale ab initio simulations accommodating generic boundary conditions in the domain of device materials inaccessible thus far.
