  abstract={The precise knowledge of the atomic order in monocrystalline alloys is fundamental to understand and predict their physical properties. With this perspective, we utilized laser-assisted atom probe tomography to investigate the three-dimensional distribution of atoms in nonequilibrium epitaxial Sn-rich group-IV SiGeSn ternary semiconductors. Different atom probe statistical analysis tools including frequency distribution analysis, partial radial distribution functions, and nearest-neighbor analysis were employed in order to evaluate and compare the behavior of the three elements to their spatial distributions in an ideal solid solution. This atomistic-level analysis provided clear evidence of an unexpected repulsive interaction between Sn and Si leading to the deviation of Si atoms from the theoretical random distribution. This departure from an ideal solid solution is supported by first-principles calculations and attributed to the tendency of the system to reduce its mixing enthalpy throughout the layer-by-layer growth process.},

  abstract = {Recent hardware-aware matrix-free algorithms for higher-order finite-element (FE) discretized matrix-vector multiplications reduce floating point operations and data access costs compared to traditional sparse matrix approaches. In this work, we address a critical gap in existing matrix-free implementations which are not well suited for the action of FE discretized matrices on very large number of vectors. In particular, we propose efficient matrix-free algorithms for evaluating FE discretized matrix-multivector products on both multi-node CPU and GPU architectures. To this end, we employ batched evaluation strategies, with the batchsize tailored to underlying hardware architectures, leading to better data locality and enabling further parallelization. On CPUs, we utilize even-odd decomposition, SIMD vectorization, and overlapping computation and communication strategies. On GPUs, we develop strategies to overlap compute with data movement for achieving efficient pipelining and reduced data accesses through the use of GPU-shared memory, constant memory and kernel fusion. Our implementation outperforms the baselines for Helmholtz operator action on 1024 vectors, achieving up to 1.4x improvement on one CPU node and up to 2.8x on one GPU node, while reaching up to 4.4x and 1.5x improvement on multiple nodes for CPUs (3072 cores) and GPUs (24 GPUs), respectively. We further benchmark the performance of the proposed implementation for solving a model eigenvalue problem for 1024 smallest eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs by employing the Chebyshev Filtered Subspace Iteration method, achieving up to 1.5x improvement on one CPU node and up to 2.2x on one GPU node while reaching up to 3.0x and 1.4x improvement on multi-node CPUs (3072 cores) and GPUs (24 GPUs), respectively.},

	abstract = {We introduce an efficient finite-element approach for large-scale real-space pseudopotential density functional theory (DFT) calculations incorporating noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling. The approach, implemented within the open-source DFT-FE computational framework, fills a significant gap in real-space DFT calculations using finite element basis sets, which offer several advantages over traditional DFT basis sets. In particular, we leverage the local reformulation of DFT electrostatics to derive the finite-element (FE) discretized governing equations involving two-component spinors. We subsequently utilize an efficient self-consistent field iteration approach based on Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration procedure exploiting the sparsity of local and non-local parts of FE discretized Hamiltonian to solve the underlying nonlinear eigenvalue problem based on a two-grid strategy. Furthermore, we propose using a generalized functional within the framework of noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling with a stationary point at the minima of the Kohn-Sham DFT energy functional to develop a unified framework for computing atomic forces and periodic unit-cell stresses. Validation studies against plane-wave implementations show excellent agreement in ground-state energetics, vertical ionization potentials, magnetic anisotropy energies, band structures, and spin textures. The proposed method achieves up to 8x-11x speed-ups for semi-periodic and non-periodic systems with {\textasciitilde}5000-7000 electrons in terms of minimum wall times compared to widely used plane-wave implementations on CPUs in addition to exhibiting significant computational advantage on GPUs.},

	abstract = {The so-called D4 model is presented for the accurate computation of London dispersion interactions in density functional theory approximations (DFT-D4) and generally for atomistic modeling methods. In this successor to the DFT-D3 model, the atomic coordination-dependent dipole polarizabilities are scaled based on atomic partial charges which can be taken from various sources. For this purpose, a new charge-dependent parameter-economic scaling function is designed. Classical charges are obtained from an atomic electronegativity equilibration procedure for which efficient analytical derivatives with respect to nuclear positions are developed. A numerical Casimir-Polder integration of the atom-in-molecule dynamic polarizabilities then yields charge- and geometry-dependent dipole-dipole dispersion coefficients. Similar to the D3 model, the dynamic polarizabilities are precomputed by time-dependent DFT and all elements up to radon (Z = 86) are covered. The two-body dispersion energy expression has the usual sum-over-atom-pairs form and includes dipole-dipole as well as dipole-quadrupole interactions. For a benchmark set of 1225 molecular dipole-dipole dispersion coefficients, the D4 model achieves an unprecedented accuracy with a mean relative deviation of 3.8\% compared to 4.7\% for D3. In addition to the two-body part, three-body effects are described by an Axilrod-Teller-Muto term. A common many-body dispersion expansion was extensively tested, and an energy correction based on D4 polarizabilities is found to be advantageous for larger systems. Becke-Johnson-type damping parameters for DFT-D4 are determined for more than 60 common density functionals. For various standard energy benchmark sets, DFT-D4 slightly but consistently outperforms DFT-D3. Especially for metal containing systems, the introduced charge dependence of the dispersion coefficients improves thermochemical properties. We suggest (DFT-)D4 as a physically improved and more sophisticated dispersion model in place of DFT-D3 for DFT calculations as well as other low-cost approaches like semi-empirical models.},

	abstract = {A new model, termed D4, for the efficient computation of molecular dipole-dipole dispersion coefficients is presented. As in the related, well established D3 scheme, these are obtained as a sum of atom-in-molecule dispersion coefficients over atom pairs. Both models make use of dynamic polarizabilities obtained from first-principles time-dependent density functional theory calculations for atoms in different chemical environments employing fractional atomic coordination numbers for interpolation. Different from the D3 model, the coefficients are obtained on-the-fly by numerical Casimir-Polder integration of the dynamic, atomic polarizabilities α(iω). Most importantly, electronic density information is now incorporated via atomic partial charges computed at a semi-empirical quantum mechanical tight-binding level, which is used to scale the polarizabilities. Extended statistical measures show that errors for dispersion coefficients with the proposed D4 method are significantly lower than with D3 and other, computationally more involved schemes. Alongside, accurate isotropic charge and hybridization dependent, atom-in-molecule static polarizabilities are obtained with an unprecedented efficiency. Damping function parameters are provided for three standard density functionals, i.e., TPSS, PBE0, and B3LYP, allowing evaluation of the new DFT-D4 model for common non-covalent interaction energy benchmark sets.},

	abstract = {We derive the expressions for configurational forces in Kohn-Sham density functional theory, which correspond to the generalized variational force computed as the derivative of the Kohn-Sham energy functional with respect to the position of a material point \${\textbackslash}textbf\{x\}\$. These configurational forces that result from the inner variations of the Kohn-Sham energy functional provide a unified framework to compute atomic forces as well as stress tensor for geometry optimization. Importantly, owing to the variational nature of the formulation, these configurational forces inherently account for the Pulay corrections. The formulation presented in this work treats both pseudopotential and all-electron calculations in single framework, and employs a local variational real-space formulation of Kohn-Sham DFT expressed in terms of the non-orthogonal wavefunctions that is amenable to reduced-order scaling techniques. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the proposed configurational force approach on benchmark all-electron and pseudopotential calculations conducted using higher-order finite-element discretization. To this end, we examine the rates of convergence of the finite-element discretization in the computed forces and stresses for various materials systems, and, further, verify the accuracy from finite-differencing the energy. Wherever applicable, we also compare the forces and stresses with those obtained from Kohn-Sham DFT calculations employing plane-wave basis (pseudopotential calculations) and Gaussian basis (all-electron calculations). Finally, we verify the accuracy of the forces on large materials systems involving a metallic aluminum nanocluster containing 666 atoms and an alkane chain containing 902 atoms, where the Kohn-Sham electronic ground state is computed using a reduced-order scaling subspace projection technique (P. Motamarri and V. Gavini, Phys. Rev. B 90, 115127).},
